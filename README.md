## Description
This is a university project that we worked on during the semester to train on coding a website from scratch (backend and frontend).
The premise of the project is to make a web app that serves as an educational platfrom much like other platforms (ex. Udemy, Coursera, etc...).
We were required to use MERN in addition to any other technology that we deemed need and we were provided with a set of requirements that needs to be met.
